Download_STEREO_Images.sh HELP FILE
*************************


To execute:

    ./Download_STEREO_Images.sh [--help] [--ohelp] [-c] [-d] [-r] [-s] [-u]

Description:

    --help	Prints this help file.

    --dhelp	Prints current and data directory paths and data URL path.

    --ohelp	Prints start/end dates of STEREO-A orbits.

    -c, --coord Prompts user to enter a star name, outputs the star's celestial
		coordinates before halting execution.

    -d, --dir	Prompts user to change directory paths.

		First path is to this script to be verified by the user.
		This is necessary to establish a path to the directory/URL text file.

		Second path is to the base STEREO HI1A data directory.
		Default has the form ##/##/stereo/h1a

		If this is updated here, it should also be updated when the user runs
		the script to process the HI1A full timage data into target pixel files.

    -r, --range	Prompts user to enter a date range over which to download the images.

		Images can be selected and downloaded from a start date to an end date
		as specified by the user. Both dates should be entered in the format:

		YYYY/MM/DD

		The -r and -s switches cannot be used at  the same time and will
		cause the execution to stop.

    -s, --star	Prompts user to enter star name followed by orbit number.

		Images can be selected and downloaded to include a star of the user's
		choice during a specified orbit.

		The coordinates of the star will be acquired from SIMBAD, so the starname
		should be in a form usable by SIMBAD. For example, 12Sgr or 12 Sgr will
		both work. However, while DX Aqr will work, DXAQR will not.

		The selected orbit number should lay between 1 and 17. Use the --ohelp
		switch to see the list of STEREO A orbit numbers and their respective
		observation date/time ranges.

		The downloaded image files will include observations prior to the chosen
		star entering the field of view. The CreateTPFs program will use these
		images to search for the appearance of the star at which point the
		Target Pixel Images for the star will be produced.

		The -r and -s switches cannot be used at  the same time and will
		cause the execution to stop.

    -u, --url	Prompts user to change URL path.

		This is the base path to the STEREO HI1A data.

		Default:

		https://stereo-ssc.nascom.nasa.gov/pub/ins_data/secchi_hi/L2/a/img/hi_1
